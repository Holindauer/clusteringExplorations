# Explorations of Clustering Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of a few different clustering algorithms in numpy. The point here is mostly just to understand these algorithms, how they work and what differentiations them from each other. I am currently working in a research lab doing data sciency things. We're considering using the fast affinity propofation algorithm for our research.
# Currently Implemented
