Numpy Impl of Fast Affinity Propogation Clustering (FAP)


This notebook contains an implementation of the Fast Affinity Propogation unsupervised clusering algorithm within numpy. I am currently working in a research lab doing data sciency things. We're considering using this algorithm and, to understand it better, I decided to implement it here from scratch.
