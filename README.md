Numpy Impl of Fast Affinity Propogation Clustering (FAP)

This notebook contains implementations of exemplar based clustering algorithms. I am currently working in a research lab doing data sciency things. We're considering using an algorithm called Fast Affinity Propogation and, to understand it better, I decided to implement it here from scratch in numpy. As well as some other exemplar based clustering algs.
